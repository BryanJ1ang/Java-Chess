# Chess Board

## Phase 0 

A Chessboard application able to play games with either a default or custom arrangement of pieces. The app is fully 
functional, able to move/capture pieces and detect conditions for the game to end (check-mate, run out of time etc.) The 
application will also allow saving the states of the game to allow players to return to specific spots in a game and 
attempt different moves. This application would naturally be used by Chess players to play with their friends, to
analyze specific situations or to simply mess around with crazy set ups of pieces.
